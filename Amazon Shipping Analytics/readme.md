## 🎯 Project Objective

The Shipping Manager currently lacks visibility into how many orders are processed and shipped each month.  
This dashboard solves the problem by allowing month-level selections to track:

- Total orders placed
- Orders successfully shipped vs. not shipped
- Day-by-day shipping performance
- Geographic distribution of unshipped orders  

---

## 📊 Key Dashboard Insights

The dashboard highlights several important metrics and visualizations, including:

- **Headline KPIs**
  - Total Order Count
  - Count of Orders Not Shipped
  - % of Orders Not Shipped

- **Order Category Breakdown**
  - Orders by FMCG category (e.g., Beverages, Dairy, Seafood)

- **Trend Charts**
  - Daily shipped vs. unshipped order counts within the selected month

- **Global Map**
  - Countries with outstanding / delayed shipments

Example visual extracts from the dashboard:  
✔ Category insights and SKU distribution  
✔ Trends of shipped vs. not shipped orders demonstrated through line charts  
✔ Geographic shipping compliance using worldwide map views
