# 🚘 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

This Tableau project explores the growth, distribution, and characteristics of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States. It focuses on analyzing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to understand market trends, state-wise adoption, top-performing brands/models, and eligibility for clean fuel incentives.
